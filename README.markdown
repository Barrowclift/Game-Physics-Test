Game Physics Test
=================

The Game AI course at Drexel University sparked my interest in playing around with vectors a little bit. At the time, I was curious to also explore Python moreâ€”specifically, how Object Oriented principles would work with it since it technically supports classes. The result is exactly what it says on the tin, a little ship that let me play around with vectors a bit until I finally felt more comfortable with them.

While I never settled on a ship "weight" that felt good to me, I think this is a nice little utility for others who want to play with vectors and simulated weights. I have effectively removed the ship's weight so by default the ship is very slippery, hopefully encouraging experimentation from anyone that wants to try it out.
