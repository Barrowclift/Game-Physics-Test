Game Physics Test
=================

Over a year ago now I was inspired by my Game AI course to play around with vectors a little bit. At the time I was curious to also explore Python more &#8212; specifically how tenable Object Oriented principles are with it. The result is exactly what it says on the tin, a little ship that let me play around with vectors a bit until I finally felt comfortable with them.

While I never settled on a ship "weight" that felt good to me I think this is a nice little utility for others who want to play with vectors and simulated weights. I have effectively removed the ship's weight so by default the ship is very slippery, hopefully encouraging experimentation from anyone that wants to try it out.
