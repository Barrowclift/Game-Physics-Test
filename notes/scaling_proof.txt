alright:
	window starts off at 500px height
	resize to 650px
	horizontalscale = 650 / 500
	so bullet that was 10px becomes 10 * 1.3
	bullet height is now 13px

	user then shrinks the window to 300px height
	horizontalscale = 300 / 650
	so bullet that was 13px becomes 13 * 0.46
	bullet height is now 6px

TIME TO CHECK THE MATH

	window starts off at 500px height
	resize to 300px
	horizontalscale = 300 / 500
	so bullet that was 10px becomes 10 * 0.6
	bullet height is now 6px

EVERYTHING SEEMS TO CHECK OUT


BUT, that’s not what I’m doing! Everything’s growing EXPONENTIALLY!!! NO!!!!
