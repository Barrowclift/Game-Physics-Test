TODO:

Lots of stuff. So you have bullets "working", great.

* Have the bullet speed match that of the ship. If I have momentum built up, so should the bullet
* Refactor and refine the project again, this time for the bullets. This isn’t good in it's current state
* Perhaps find a better way to manage timers?
* Abstract the “original” and current values with some sort of struct or class, right now it’s messy as HELL and error prone.
